Problem Statement: Using partial least squares regression for generalized linear models (the plsRglm package in R) using caret package, build an ensemble model to predict the quality score given to each wine from the Vinho Verde region of Portugal.

Project Objective: Predict the quality of Wine

Data:  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality

The data consists of 11 features which are: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol; and 1 output variable which is quality of wine. There are two data sets for red and white wine types. Data sets will be concatenated, and general model is going to be trained for both red and white wine types.

Programming Language:  R

Let’s get started….
